Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile, my name is Rand Hale. I am a junior web developer who is eager to learn and develop my skills day by day. I enjoy cooking, tranquility, and coding  to the soft background hum of my dear friends talking and playing games. Some day I would like to write a cookbook of my favorite home recipes, free of obstrusive anecdotes, and stylishly display it on a webpage of my own making. Stay tuned...
